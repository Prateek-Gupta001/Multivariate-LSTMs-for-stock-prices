# 📈 Stock Price Prediction with Multivariate LSTMs

In this project, I've implemented **Multivariate LSTMs** to predict the stock prices of **RELIANCE** using data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) via the `yfinance` library.

## 🗂️ Data Features
The dataset features used as input sequences are:
- `open`
- `high`
- `low`
- `close`
- `close_change`
- `volume`

## ⚙️ Libraries Used
This project primarily uses the **PyTorch** library for model building and training. Additionally, I’ve created a custom base class for dataset creation to handle the data efficiently.

## 🔧 Future Work
I plan to make further improvements and refinements to the model to enhance prediction accuracy and overall performance. Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
